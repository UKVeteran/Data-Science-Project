# 📊 Data Science Project

Welcome to the **Data Science Project**! This project aims to solve a specific problem using data analysis and machine learning. It involves data collection, preprocessing, model building, and evaluation, with results visualized for actionable insights.

## 🛠️ Project Structure
Here's a breakdown of the project directory structure:
```bash
📦 ds-project
├── data/               # Contains input datasets
│   ├── raw/            # Raw, unprocessed data
│   ├── processed/      # Cleaned and transformed data
├── notebooks/          # Jupyter notebooks for exploration and analysis
├── src/                # Source code for data processing and model training
│   ├── data_loader.py
│   ├── preprocess.py
│   ├── model.py
│   ├── evaluate.py
├── results/            # Output models, visualizations, and reports
├── requirements.txt    # Python dependencies
├── main.py             # Main script to run the pipeline
└── README.md           # Project documentation
```

## 🚀 Installation
Get started with the following steps:
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ds-project.git

# Navigate to the project directory
cd ds-project

# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv env

# Activate the virtual environment (Linux/macOS)
source env/bin/activate

# For Windows:
env\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 📥 Data
Place your dataset in the `data/raw/` directory. Ensure it is in CSV or a compatible format:
```bash
📦 data/
└── raw/
    └── dataset.csv
```
If the dataset needs to be downloaded, update the instructions with appropriate links.

## 🚦 Usage
Run the main analysis pipeline using the following command:
```bash
python main.py
```
This will:
- Load and preprocess the data
- Train and evaluate the model
- Generate visualizations and save results in the `results/` directory

## 📊 Results
After running the pipeline, check the `results/` directory for the outputs:
- **model.pkl**: Trained model for future predictions
- **metrics.txt**: Evaluation results with key metrics
- **visualizations/**: Graphs and plots for analysis

## 🧪 Testing
Ensure all components are functioning correctly by running the test suite:
```bash
python -m unittest discover tests/
```
